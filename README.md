# GIT Notes App

This repo collects the attempts to implement a simple application to save notes in a git repository.

Each note is an individual markdown file with a title, tags (separated by spaces) and the content.

I will document different attempts using different approaches as versions of the the application.

For each attempt I will capture the promts used and the interactions with the AI as well as any manual changes I made.
