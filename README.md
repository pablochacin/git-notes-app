# GIT Notes App

This repo collects the attempts to implement a simple application to save notes in a git repository.

Each note is an individual markdown file with a title, tags (separated by spaces) and the content.

I will document different attempts using different approaches as versions of the the application.

For each attempt I will capture the prompts used and the interactions with the AI as well as any manual changes I made.

## V1

[V1](./v1/) is the first version created using claude 3.7 Sonnet with only generic directions and minimal interventions, no code review or indications of how to fix the issues. Only a couple of manual changes were applied to fix build errors (evident from the go build messages).

The result was fully functional after a few iterations.

See the [v1 README.md](v1/README.md) for more details
